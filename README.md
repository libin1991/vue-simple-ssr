# Vue SSR Starter

Based on Vue HN 2.0

## Notes

- ./src/assets/images directory and it's contents are created automatically by webpack build. 
The original files are located under ./static/images directory. Assets directory can be ignored in git, and also can be safely deleted before builds.
Fix this later to prevent asset duplication
